    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>What happens when you mash up crazy cat ladies (and gentlemen) with cozy couches and chefs who know what they're
        doing?
        You get the world's only cat cafe specialising in ice-cream. Yes. Just this year we ventured out of the box to
        buy
        our premises
        and freezers, as well as introducing all our fur-babies to those of our friends. The result? A once in a
        lifetime
        place, where
        anything can happen.</p>

    <p>What happens when you get in a conversation between the world's best ice cream chefs, craziest
        cat ladies, and coolest designers? A lot of creativity, good food, and cats. But what if you add in
        people who know how to buy shopfronts in Melbourne's CBD, and those who are willing to give
        anything a shot?
    </p>

    <p>You get Creamy Kitties.</p>

    <p>World's first ice cream specialising cat cafe. And already winner of the most intriguing business
        idea of the year, with awards also for our atmosphere and great ice cream. With our innovative
        designers working constantly to better the environment and furniture (human and cat) of our cafe
        and the world, flavour inventors working on new ice creams and delicious dishes, chefs cooking
        away, and cat ladies on quality control, (not to mention the kids who get to test new ice cream
        flavours), it's no wonder Creamy Kitties is a success in its first year.
    </p>

        <p>
            I've got to say, I'm impressed. I'm a web developer, and lover of cats, (I grew up with them) but my
            husband is allergic. It's such a comfort to be able to go back to my childhood in <em>Creamy Kitties</em>,
            with a cat on my lap, and a computer to tinker with.
